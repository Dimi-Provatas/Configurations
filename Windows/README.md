# Windows Configuratios

In here are the configuration files for my windows setup.
I prefer to use the [Windows Terminal App](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-us&gl=us), with [OH-MY-POSH](https://ohmyposh.dev/) and [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/)

### Locations

From this directory, everything should be copied over to the home directory of the user with `cp -r * ~/`
